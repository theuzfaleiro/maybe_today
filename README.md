# Maybe Today

App created using MVVM Architecture and Google Architecture Components (Live Data and View Model).

The Room library was used to store data in the database.

The Koin library was used to improve dependency injection management.

Mockk was used to improve productivity when writing unit tests.
To maintain and ensure that all the tests (unit and instrumented) are successful, Bitrise executes both test suites for every open Pull Request at a feature branch.

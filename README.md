Maybe Today

App created using MVVM Architecture and Google Architecture Components (Live Data and View Model).

The Room library was used to store data in the database. Koin was used to improve dependency injection management.

Mockk was used to improve productivity when writing unit tests.

To maintain, ensure that all the tests (unit and instrumented) are successful, Bitrise is executing both test suites for every open Pull Request at develop branch. Also, Bitrise is executing when the Pull Request was approved to merge with the develop branch.
